# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is a critical step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simplified, low-fidelity visual representations of a website or applicationâ€™s layout and functionality. Wireframes are typically created before any actual design or development work begins.

## Importance of Wireframing

Wireframes serve as a blueprint for design and development teams. Their benefits include:

- **Clarity**: They help define the structure and flow of a product without distractions from colors or typography.
- **User Focus**: Wireframes prioritize functionality and user experience, helping identify usability issues early.
- **Communication**: They act as a visual guide to align stakeholders, designers, and developers on the project vision.
- **Efficiency**: Wireframes save time and resources by allowing rapid iterations before diving into high-fidelity design and development.
